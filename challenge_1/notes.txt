x- installed, had to change path with => export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.npm-global/bin
 x - create a simple web+api server from your JSON data source
 x - configure to serve up static assets from your public folder

x- SET UP HTML file
x- set up package.json
x- set up react DOM page
x- set up webpack config file
  x- Target webpack to build into the public folder
  x- install babel npm install -g webpack
  x- install dependencies - webpack-cli babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react react-dom
  **** => make sure the folder is visible to the json-server, but you do not need to add the static file location ***
  x- set up dependencies in the webpack config file
x- run webpack to start bundle

x- Build a React UI that allows the user to search for historical events based on a keyword.
x- Use the full-text search features of json-server to return a result to the UI for browsing.
x- Paginate the list of events using react-paginate, loading no more than ten at a time.
x- Ensure you are implementing server-side pagination  NOT client-side pagination.

x- That data is messy! Add an edit button on the UI to allow the historical event information to be edited.
x---> stuck on submitting changes showing up in the console and registering in the state change
  - Allow those edits to be saved back to the server using a save button.
    - need to find input value now or find a way to search through json data
      - possibly add routes??
    - and change that data
  - Add the feature of "Favoriting" a historical event: when the user favorites an event, they are prompted for a "Favorite Set".
  -The user may select an already existing "Favorite Set" or may wish to create a new "Favorite Set."
  - What's a Favorite Set? Instead of having only one set of favorites, some sites (like Airbnb) allow users to create many sets of favorites, where each set has a unique name.
  - For example, a user might favorite some events into "War Story" favorites and others into "Science Story" favorites.
- Use react-router to navigate throughout the app.
  - Allow the user to navigate to a page where they can see all of their Favorite Sets and another page to see all the events of a selected Favorite Set.
  - Don't forget to let the user navigate back to the search page.
